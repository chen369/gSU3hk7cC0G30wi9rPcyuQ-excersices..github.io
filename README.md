# PacMan Coding Assignment

If you've ever played an arcade game, then you're familiar with Pac-Man!
This is the game where the player controls PacMan who travels inside a maze trying to eat all the dots while avoiding the colorful ghosts.
However, I'll be building a mini version of the game that will only focus on the moving Pac-Man from one side of the screen to the other. It's going to be a fun project to work on as part of a MIT xPRO Excersise.
